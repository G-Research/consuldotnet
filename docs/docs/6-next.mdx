# What is Next?

Curious about what's coming next? you can use the Preview builds (aka 'nightly' builds) that are distributed using https://feedz.io/ for now.

![Feedz](https://img.shields.io/feedz/vpre/consuldotnet/preview/consul)

To pull preview versions into your project, use the following `NuGet.config` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="consuldotnet-preview" value="https://f.feedz.io/consuldotnet/preview/nuget/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
