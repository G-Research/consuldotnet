# Introduction

Consul.NET is a .NET port of the Go Consul API, but reworked to use .NET idioms such as Tasks/CancellationTokens instead
of Goroutines/Channels. The majority of the calls directly track
the [HTTP API](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html), but this API does have additional functionality that is
provided in the Go API, like Locks and Semaphores.

> **Note:** This version indicates the version of Consul API that is fully supported. Recent versions of Consul API still work, but some features may be missing. Read more about [Consul.NET versioning](./3-contributing/6-release-process.mdx#versioning) and the currently [Supported APIs](./2-guides/3-supported-apis.mdx).
