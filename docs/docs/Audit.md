## Notes

- It's included here that the repo lacks a github pull request template and issue template according to repolinter. However, templates for PRs and issues appear to rely on default github issue and PR forms which works like a template.

- The setup and contributor documentation could benefit from clearer differentiation between _users_ (NuGet consumers) and _contributors_.

- Some files that appear missing based on the community docs check are actually present but with a different name format or paths.

- RepoLinter flagged several missing files that do exist in the repository but under slightly different names or locations (e.g. test directory, changelog, etc).
