# Using with .NET Core and Mono

Both **<DotNetSupportedVersion/>** and **<DotNetCoreSupportedVersion/>** are fully supported. **Mono** is supported on a
best-effort basis. It should compile and run happily on Mono but this is not as
heavily tested as Microsoft .NET stacks. If you have any issues using the *Nuget package* or *compiling* this code with **.NET**, **.NET Core**, or **Mono**, please [create an issue](../3-contributing/3-report-issue.mdx) with details of the problem.
