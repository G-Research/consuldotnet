# Usage

All operations are done using a `ConsulClient` object. First,
instantiate a `ConsulClient` object, which connects to `localhost:8500`,
the default Consul HTTP API port. Once you've got a `ConsulClient`
object, various functionality is exposed as properties under the
`ConsulClient`.

All responses are wrapped in `QueryResponse` and `WriteResponse`
classes, which provide metadata about the request, like how long it
took and the monotonic Consul index when the operation occured.

This API also assumes some knowledge of Consul, including things like
[blocking queries and consistency modes](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html)

### ACL

The ACL endpoints are used to create, update, destroy, and query Legacy ACL tokens.

### ACLReplication

The ACLReplication endpoint is used to query the status of ACL Replication.

### Agent

The Agent endpoints are used to interact with the local Consul agent.
Usually, services and checks are registered with an agent which then
takes on the burden of keeping that data synchronized with the cluster.
For example, the agent registers services and checks with the Catalog
and performs anti-entropy to recover from outages.

### AuthMethod

The AuthMethod endpoints are used to create, update, destroy, and query ACL Auth Methods
related to ACL Replication. **These are untested and a place-holder for future changes.**

### Catalog

The Catalog is the endpoint used to register and deregister nodes,
services, and checks. It also provides query endpoints.

### Event

The Event endpoints are used to fire new events and to query the
available events.

### Health

The Health endpoints are used to query health-related information. They
are provided separately from the Catalog since users may prefer not to
use the optional health checking mechanisms. Additionally, some of the
query results from the Health endpoints are filtered while the Catalog
endpoints provide the raw entries.

### KV

The KV endpoint is used to access Consul's simple key/value store,
useful for storing service configuration or other metadata.

### Policy

The Policy endpoint is used to create, update, delete and read ACL Policies

### Role

The Role endpoint is used to create, update, delete and read ACL Roles

### Query

The Prepared Query endpoints are used to create, update, destroy, and
execute prepared queries. Prepared queries allow you to register a
complex service query and then execute it later via its ID or name to
get a set of healthy nodes that provide a given service.

### Session

The Session endpoints are used to create, destroy, and query sessions.

### Status

The Status endpoints are used to get information about the status of the
Consul cluster. This information is generally very low level and not
often useful for clients.

### Token

The Token endpoint is used to create, update, clone, delete and read ACL Tokens

### Additional Functions

Functionality based on the Consul guides using the available primitives
has been implemented as well, just like the Go API.

### Lock

Lock is used to implement client-side leader election for a distributed
lock. It is an implementation of the [Consul Leader Election](https://consul.io/docs/guides/leader-election.html) guide.

### Semaphore

Semaphore is used to implement a distributed semaphore using the Consul
KV primitives. It is an implementation of the [Consul Semaphore](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/semaphore.html) guide.

### Namespaces

Namespaces help reduce operational challenges by removing restrictions
around uniqueness of resource names across distinct teams, and enable operators to provide self-service through
delegation of administrative privileges. It is an implementation of
[Consul Namespaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise/namespaces).
