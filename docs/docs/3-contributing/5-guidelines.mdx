# Guidelines

Submission and coding guidelines for the Consul.NET project.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with
quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Consul/Consul.NET Version(s)** - is it a regression?
* **Operating System** - is this a problem with all platforms or only specific ones?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a example or an unambiguous set of steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)

**If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!**

### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/G-Research/consuldotnet) for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout -b my-fix-branch develop
    ```

* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
* Run the test suite using the development environment described below.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

  ```shell
  git commit -a
    ```
Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.
* Make sure you use a distinctive commit author name.
* Push your branch to GitHub:

  ```shell
  git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

In GitHub, send a pull request to `consuldotnet:master`.

If we suggest changes, then:

* Make the required updates.
* Re-run the test suite to ensure tests are still passing.
* Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. `my-fix-branch`).
* Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).

If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update the PR:

```shell
git rebase target_branch -i
git push origin my-fix-branch -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the master branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## Coding

### Developer Environment

- Visual Studio 2019 (with latest patches/updates), with the following workloads/components
  - Developer packs for <DotNetFrameworkDevVersion/>.

Or just VS Code and latest stable .NET SDKs.

Alternatively, You can use GitPod and start contributing directly.

### Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more unit tests (if possible and applicable).
* All public API methods **must be documented** with XML documentation.
