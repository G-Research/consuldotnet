# Request a Feature ?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to [our issue tracker](https://github.com/G-Research/consuldotnet/issues).
If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an issue, so that we can better coordinate our efforts,
prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the GitHub Repository as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/G-Research/consuldotnet/pulls).
