# Basic Example

Once Consul is running (you'll see something like `==> Consul
agent running!`) in your command prompt, then do the following
steps in your project.

Add a reference to the Consul library and add a using statement:

```csharp
using Consul;
```

Write a function to talk to the KV store:

```csharp
public static async Task<string> HelloConsul()
{
    using (var client = new ConsulClient())
    {
        var putPair = new KVPair("hello")
        {
            Value = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello Consul")
        };

        var putAttempt = await client.KV.Put(putPair);

        if (putAttempt.Response)
        {
            var getPair = await client.KV.Get("hello");
            return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(getPair.Response.Value, 0,
                getPair.Response.Value.Length);
        }
        return "";
    }
}
```

And call it:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(HelloConsul().GetAwaiter().GetResult());
```

You should see `Hello Consul` in the output of your program. You should
also see the following lines in your command prompt, if you're running
a local Consul server:

```log
[DEBUG] http: Request /v1/kv/hello (6.0039ms)
[DEBUG] http: Request /v1/kv/hello (0)
```

The API just went out to Consul, wrote "Hello Consul" under the key
"hello", then fetched the data back out and wrote it to your prompt.
