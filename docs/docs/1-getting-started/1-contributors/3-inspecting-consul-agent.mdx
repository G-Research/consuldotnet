## **Inspecting Local Consul Agent Logs**
When running a local Consul Agent (e.g., via consul agent -dev -config-file test_config.json), logs appear directly in the same terminal window or console.
These logs provide real-time insights into the agent's operations, including service registrations, health checks, and any errors or warnings.

An example of your startup log would look like this:
```lua
==> Starting Consul agent...
        Version: '1.14.0'
        Node ID: 'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890'
        Node name: 'your-machine-name'
        Datacenter: 'dc1' (Segment: '<all>')
        Server: true (Bootstrap: true)
        Client Addr: [127.0.0.1] (HTTP: 8500, HTTPS: -1, gRPC: 8502, gRPC-TLS: 8503, DNS: 8600)
        Cluster Addr: 127.0.0.1 (LAN: 8301, WAN: 8302)
        Gossip Encryption: true
        Auto-Encrypt-TLS: false
        ACL Enabled: true
        Reporting Enabled: false
        ACL Default Policy: allow
        HTTPS TLS: Verify Incoming: false, Verify Outgoing: false, Min Version: TLSv1_2
        gRPC TLS: Verify Incoming: false, Min Version: TLSv1_2
        Internal RPC TLS: Verify Incoming: false, Verify Outgoing: false (Verify Hostname: false), Min Version: TLSv1_2
==> Log data will now stream in as it occurs:
```
These logs show real-time events like node joins, service registrations, and key/value updates.
Keep this console open while testing your contribution...it’s your real-time feedback loop.


## **Inspecting Local Agent State via Web UI**
When Consul runs in dev mode, it automatically serves a Web UI that lets you visualize the cluster’s current state which can be accessed via your browser on `http://127.0.0.1:8500/ui`.

Here, you can explore components of your cluster such as:
- **Services**: View registered services, their health status, and metadata.
- **Nodes**: See all nodes in the cluster, their status, and associated services.
- **Key/Value**: Inspect and manage key/value pairs stored in Consul.
- **Intentions**: Manage communication permissions between services.
- **Tokens**: View and manage ACL tokens used for authentication and authorization.
- **Policies**: Manage ACL policies that define access rules.
etc.

**Useful Tip**: Use the Web UI to verify that your tests register/deregister services correctly or modify expected state.
It’s also a great place to debug unexpected behavior before submitting a PR.
