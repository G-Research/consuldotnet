## **Running Tests**

Once your local Consul Agent is running, you can verify your changes and contributions by running the tests.

---

**PS**: **Make sure you’ve written or updated unit tests relevant to your contribution.**
### Option 1: Using Visual Studio's GUI.

If you’re using Visual Studio:

1. Open the **Test Explorer** panel (`Test` → `Test Explorer`).
2. Build the project to ensure all test assemblies are loaded.
3. Select the test or test class you want to run.  
   You can filter by project or namespace if needed.
4. Click **Run** or **Debug** to execute the selected test(s).

### Option 2: Using the Command Line

If you prefer using the command line:

1. Navigate into the `Consul.Test` project directory.
   ```bash
   cd Consul.Test
   ```
2. Run the tests in the Consul.Test project using the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```
    This command will build the test project and execute all tests, providing output in the terminal that looks like this:
    ```console
    Passed!  - Failed: 0, Passed: 124, Skipped: 0, Total: 124
    ```
    For more precision, you can filter the tests by class and even down to a specific test method. For example:
    ```bash
    dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName~Consul.Tests.Agent
    ```
    This will run only the tests in the `Consul.Tests.Agent` class.
    
    To run a single test method: for example, a test named Catalog_GetServices:
    ```bash
    dotnet test --filter FullyQualifiedName=Consul.Tests.Agent.Catalog_GetServices
    ```
