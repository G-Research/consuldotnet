# Setting up Consul Server

You'll need a running Consul Server on your local machine, or a Consul
Agent connected to a Consul Server cluster. To run a local server:

## On Windows

1. [Download a copy](https://www.consul.io/downloads.html) of the latest Windows
version and unzip it into the `Consul.Test` folder.
2. Open a command prompt and `cd` to the `Consul.Test` folder.
3. Run `.\consul.exe agent -dev -config-file test_config.json`

## On MacOS

1. [Download a copy](https://www.consul.io/downloads.html) of the latest version for your system:
   - `darwin_amd64` for Intel Macs
   - `darwin_arm64` for Apple Silicon
2. Unzip the downloaded archive. It contains the `consul` executable and a `LICENSE` text file.
3. Copy both the `consul` executable and `LICENSE` file into the `Consul.Test` folder.
4. Open a command prompt and `cd` to the `Consul.Test` folder.
5. Run `consul agent -dev -config-file test_config.json`

This creates a 1-server cluster that operates in "dev" mode (does not
write data to disk) and listens on `127.0.0.1:8500`.

Note:
The version of Consul you download should match the version you're contributing to.
For example, if you're contributing to Consul 1.14.0, you should download Consul 1.14.0.
