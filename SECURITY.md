# Security and Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

This project appreciates and encourages coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Please do not post sensitive security vulnerability details in public issues.

We prefer that you use the GitHub reporting mechanism to privately report vulnerabilities. Under the main repository's security tab,  click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.

If you are unable to report it via GitHub or have received no response after some time, or have other security related questions, please contact us directly at <consuldotnet@gr-oss.io> or <security@gr-oss.io> and mention this project in the subject line.
